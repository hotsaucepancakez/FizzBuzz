# FizzBuzz
***
I already explain the task within the comments of my code. For numbers from 1 to 100, if the number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" in place of the number, if the number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" in place of the number, if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz" in place of the number, and if the number is not divisible by 3 or 5, just print the number.

The purpose of this repository was mainly for me to learn how to use Git.
